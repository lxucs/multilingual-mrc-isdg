# multilingual-mrc-isdg

Code for the AAAI 2022 paper "Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Machine Reading Comprehension via Inter-Sentence Dependency Graph".

This repository contains two directories; each directory is an independent project as follows:

* baseline: our re-implementation of the baseline adapted from the existing MRC code. It is standalone to keep the baseline code clean.

* isdg: the model with ISDG graph encoder presented in the paper.
